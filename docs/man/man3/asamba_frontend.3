This module is the user's frontend to open a graphical user interface, GUI, and interact with the 
underlying grid database and a (limited) suite of functionalities in the backend. There are millions 
of ways one can design the GUI, provide different functionalities, and/or allow the user to interact 
with the database. What is provided here is one way out of the millions of possibilities, and is a 
basic attempt to start with the GUI. Indeed, this GUI is pretty extensible, and flexible to grow and
accommodate additional tools for analysis.
